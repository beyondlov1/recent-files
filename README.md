# Recent Files README

A small extension to work as vertical tabs for most recently used files.

## Features

For a given workspace, see the most recently used files in a list view. There is no organisation to the list like which 
editor group it belongs to as this is not important to my workflow.


## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of recent files.
